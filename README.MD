<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Walleto is an application that allows users to keep track of their expenses.
By default, a user will have three wallets: Global, Loan, and saving.
The global wallet keeps track of the total amount of cost.
Loans wallet will show the dept and loans.
The saving wallet will act as your saving account.
Each wallet will show their income and outcome and provide a report on the activity of each wallet.
Base on user demand, they can create a custom wallet.

When adding a new transaction, the user has to choose their wallet and the transaction category.
When a new transaction is submitted, wallets are updated accordingly to that transaction.
